## Idea for Structure

- Brief
  Create a lightweight system that allows you to enter some contract details (start date, end date, name and contact) a set of required roles with a certain demand for skills (Java, Javascript, Python, AWS etc) against a contract. Given a set of possible candidates for the roles and their skills write a matching algorithm and display the results.

- Purpose of App
  The purpose of the app is to provide employers a quick way to create a job listing and match the relevant profiles according to the skills they check as important.
